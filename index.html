            </h3>
            <p>
              <span lang="en">With the recent migrant crisis impacting Europe and the world on an unprecedented scale, our mission is to contribute to the process of integration of refugees into these communities through innovation and technology. Refugees face a number of tough challenges once their asylum status has been obtained, but one of the most critical and most burdensome problems for European nations medium to longer term will be that of economic integration through job opportunity. Our organization aims to tackle this by providing refugees with opportunities to learn and connect with through computer literacy and code. Through action and example, we hope to break down stereotypes about these individuals and highlight their potential for contributing to their host country.</span>

                    and 50% local - learn together side by side, gaining not only technical skills, but also an exchange of different cultures,
                    languages and friendships that accelerates the inclusion of refugees into their new host community.
