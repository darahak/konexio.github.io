      <h4>Our Mission</h4>
      <p>
        With the recent migrant crisis impacting Europe and the world on an unprecedented scale, our mission is to contribute to the process of integration of refugees into these communities through innovation and technology. Refugees face a number of tough challenges once their asylum status has been obtained, but one of the most critical and most burdensome problems for European nations medium to longer term will be that of economic integration through job opportunity. Our organization aims to tackle this by providing refugees with opportunities to learn and connect with through code.

        <div class="row">
          <div class="value four columns">
            <h5>Inclusion</h5>
            <p>
              We welcome everyone of all ages and backgrounds into our community! Our initiatives are based on an inclusive and innovative model of learning that fosters exchange between participants. Our students—approximately 50% refugees and 50% local—learn together side by side, gaining not only technical skills, but also an exchange of different cultures, languages and friendships that accelerates the inclusion of refugees into their new host community.

          <div class="value four columns">
            <h5>Interchange</h5>
            <p>
              We encourage active participation and contribution from each and every individual. Former participants have come to give back to beginning students. Some of our teaching assistants are developers who are refugees themselves, including two team members who have helped to build our organization website.
            </p>

          <div class="value four columns">
            <h5>Partnership</h5>
            <p>
              We believe firmly in building a community through close partnerships on the ground. With growing partnerships and a dedicated team, Konexio aims to first empower our students with technical skills and next support them in the launch of their career aspirations—through mentorship, network, and professional development resources that can inform them on the social codes essential to navigating the professional world successfully in their host country.

          Before I thought not everyone could learn how to design web sites because it seemed difficult for me, however thanks to [these] workshops I’ve discovered a lot such as the basics of web development, how to write HTML, how to style pages using CSS, and many other things concerning web design. I truly recommend this workshop to everyone. The workshops are perfectly organized and we absorb all the lessons with full understanding. I really run out of words to express how thankful and grateful I’m for all you have done for us. It’s wonderful that there are humanitarian[s] like you in this world!
